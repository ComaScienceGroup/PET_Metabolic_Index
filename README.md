The program compute Positron emission tomography (PET) Metabolic Index for Best Hemispher (MIBH) as well different brain Network (i.e., Fronriparietal, DMN, SMN, Visual, Auditory, Subcortical etc)

Input should be PET .nii image after AC-PC plane correction and coregister with the used template space. 
Note: The program run in matlab and you should have FSL, ANT toolbox installed in your systom
